# CodingChallenges
Contains my attempts at various coding challenges.

These are simply practice exercises for myself to test/learn new stuff.
Some are constructed as quickly as possible, some are constructed to be concise and readable.

Most of it is done in Python, any other languages are me dabbling in new languages.
